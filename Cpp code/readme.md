# Tasks for C++ code implementation

- [X] General code writeups
To make a code similar to UPPAAL. No visualization has been added. Based on FCFS scheduling.

- [ ] Visualization (preferably C++ but only some functionalities, the rest maybe on PowerPoint)
The visulization will show a few different cars on the road that are color-coded, and random attributed will be added.
These include like length (because the lane is 1 car width, we do not take into account of wider length of lane), speed (e.g. the speed is 3 units/second).
We will discuss about how long each lane is.

- [ ] Streamlining function names
At the moment we are using street but maybe this can be changed to road.
Also we need to specify lane names. There are 4 rLane and they can be specified too, instead of making them generic
Or there's an option of
